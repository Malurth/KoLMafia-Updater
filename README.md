# KoLMafia-Updater
A simple tool for keeping KoLMafia updated.

## What exactly does it do?
It checks for the most recent daily build of KoLMafia available on the internet, and if you don't have a .jar of the same name in the folder you ran this tool, it will download the new build for you (complete with a nice lil progress bar). After completing this download, it will delete all other .jar files found in the same folder so as to avoid accumulating older versions. Finally, regardless of whether or not it actually updated anything, it will launch KoLMafia. Together, this should ensure that you are always running the latest version unless the tool somehow fails to connect to the intended webpage.

## How To Use
Simply extract the files contained in the zip to the same location as your KoLMafia .jar file(s), and when you want to update + launch KoLMafia, just run KoLMafia Updater.exe and wait. The UI only pops up if it finds a file to download, by the way, so if it just silently launches KoLMafia without seeming to do anything, that should just mean you're already up to date, not that it isn't working. Oh, and if you are confused as to what I mean by 'the zip,' I mean the .zip file you can find here on the Releases tab.
